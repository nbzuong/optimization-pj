'''
Generate 74 different input files with number of rectangles of:

    10 too easy
        5, 6, 7,.., 14
         
    10 easy enough
        15, 11, 12,.., 24

    10 medium
        25, 21, 22,.., 34

    10 hard
        35, 36, 37,.., 44
    
    10 severe
        45, 46, 47,.., 54
    
    10 might be impossible
        60, 90, 120,.., 330
    
    10 test the limit
        350, 400, 450,.., 800
    
    4 used for time-limited heuristics
        850, 900, 950, 1000

Randomizing algorithm:

    Each rectangle will have a randomized size, each side
        from 1 to 5 (so the area is from 1 to 25)

    Randomize a certain amount of rectangles based on
        difficulty (above)

    Pick some (from 2 to 5) random rectangles. The first one
        is putted in the upper-left corner, then randomly put each
        of the remaining next to (right or below) of any existing
        rectangle, make sure that it fits.
                The maximum side of the car is
                    5 (rectangles) x 5 (side of each rectangle) = 25.
                    Area: 25 x 25

    After putting rectangles in, "cut off" (actually by reducing the size)
        any row or column that was not used (from the lower-most row -> up,
        from the right-most column -> left)
    
    Keep doing that until there is no rectangle left.

    Randomly generate a few more car (ceil of 1/5 number of the cars used).

    Completely randomize the cost of cars (from 100 to 2000).
